# Spotijukebox: Your Playlist, Their Choice

## How It Works
1. **Spotify Playlist Integration**  
   Your existing Spotify playlist forms the base of the jukebox. This allows you to curate the vibe while leaving room for audience interaction.

2. **QR Code Access**  
   A unique QR code is generated and displayed at the venue. Guests simply scan the code with their smartphones to join the music selection process.

3. **Audience Voting**  
   The QR code leads participants to a web interface where they can:
   - View your playlist
   - Vote for their favorite tracks
   - Suggest songs (if enabled)

4. **Dynamic Playback**  
   Songs with the most votes rise to the top of the queue, creating a collaborative and dynamic music experience that evolves with the crowd’s preferences.
